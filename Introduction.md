# Welcome to ElmBridge!

Today, you're going to be learning Elm! So exciting!

This tutorial is meant to be completed over the course of 5 hours, broken up into two chunks:
 - 2.5 hours on learning the basics of the language.
 - 3 hours building an Elm application from scratch — specifically, an emoji translator!

By the end of this tutorial, you can expect to:

- Know what Elm is, and why people use it.
- Be familiar with the core data structures of the language.
- Understand the architecture of Elm applications.
- Be able to build interactive front-end applications in Elm.

Thanks for coming! Let's get started.

## Setup

We're going to be working with:

- The latest version of the Elm language platform.
- The terminal.
- The text editor of your choice.
- The web browser of your choice.

At various points today, you'll also be asked to download code from GitHub, so internet access is also required.

### Installing Elm

If you haven't done so already, follow [the official Elm guide](https://guide.elm-lang.org/install/elm.html) for installing the language platform. **Note for Windows users:** You might want to check our [handy Windows installation checklist](Special Installation Notes.md) to guide you through installation.

You can verify everything is working by launching the Elm REPL ([What is a REPL?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop)) by running the following command in your terminal:

```sh
elm repl
```

If you see the following message, you are ready to go!

```
---- Elm 0.19.1 ----------------------------------------------------------------
Say :help for help and :exit to exit! More at <https://elm-lang.org/0.19.1/repl>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
>
```

When you're done exploring, you can type `:exit` to get out.
